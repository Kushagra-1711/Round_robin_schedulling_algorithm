🗓️ Round Robin CPU Scheduling Visualizer
This is an interactive, web-based tool designed to visualize the Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduling algorithm. It provides a step-by-step simulation, making it easier for computer science students and enthusiasts to understand its core concepts.

This entire application is built into a single index.html file, using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

(Replace the link above with your actual GitHub Pages URL after you deploy it!)

(Note: To make the image above work, take a screenshot of your running application, name it screenshot.png, and add it to your repository.)

✨ Features
Interactive Process Management: Add/delete processes with custom Arrival Times (AT) and Burst Times (BT).

Configurable Time Quantum: Set the time slice (TQ) for the simulation.

Step-by-Step Control: Play, pause, or step through the simulation one time unit at a time.

Live Visualization: Watch the Ready Queue, CPU, and Gantt Chart update in real-time.

Final Results: Automatically calculates and displays Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT) for each process, along with the averages.

Clean, Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, dark-mode look on all devices.

🚀 Deployment on GitHub Pages
This is a static web page (just one HTML file), so deploying it on GitHub Pages is free and very simple.

Create a Repository:

Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., round-robin-visualizer).

Upload Your Files:

Add your index.html file to this new repository.

Add this README.md file.

Add your screenshot.png (once you take it).

Enable GitHub Pages:

In your repository, go to the Settings tab.

In the "Code and automation" section on the left, click on Pages.

Under "Build and deployment," set the Source to Deploy from a branch.

Set the Branch to main (or master) and the folder to / (root).

Click Save.

Wait and See:

After a minute or two, your site will be live! GitHub will display the URL on that same "Pages" screen (it will look like https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/).

💻 How to Run Locally
You don't need a web server or any special tools. Just double-click the index.html file to open it in your local web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: For the core structure and layout.

Tailwind CSS: For all utility-first styling (CDN link).

JavaScript (ES6+): For the entire simulation logic and DOM manipulation.
